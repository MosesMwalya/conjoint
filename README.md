# [Conjoint Study].()
Deciding between two or more options is often difficult because we like some features in one option and some features in the other. We are left with a feeling that perhaps the features I like should have been combined to form an extra option but that extra option could also have something we don't like so much like price. In the mix of this, we find ourselves making trade-offs by picking options that we feel would deliver optimal value.

So begs the question, what does data-driven organizations do to decipher the ideal mix of features that most customer would prefer or would choose? Certainly, such organizations canâ€™t afford to make educated guesses - Well, among the tools that are preferred is the Conjoint study.

## Overview
The conjoint study is a statistical technique that helps to determine how people value, prefer, and choose different attributes (e.g. feature, benefits etc) that make up an individual product or service. By simulating real-world decision-making scenarios, conjoint analysis enables businesses to dissect the elements that influence customers' choices and prioritize features that contribute most to overall satisfaction.

The objective of conjoint analysis is to determine what combination of a limited number of attributes is most influential on respondent choice or decision-making. A controlled set of potential products or services is shown to survey respondents and by analyzing how they make preferences between these products, the implicit valuation of the individual elements making up the product or service can be determined. These implicit valuations (utilities or part-worths) can be used to create market models that estimate market share, revenue and even profitability of new designs.

Conjoints are invaluable resources that is popular in product development, pricing strategies, marketing campaigns among others. Through conjoint, businesses can gain insights into the trade-offs customers are willing to make thereby aiding in the creation of products and services that align closely with market demands.


## Problem statement
In today's dynamic and competitive business landscape, understanding customer preferences is essential for staying ahead of the curve. However, the  intricacy of consumer decision-making, shaped by a multitude of circumstances, makes it challenging to identify drivers behind their choice for product and services. My client, a pizza marketing and selling business finds themselves in that predicament.

The problem at hand is the need for a systematic and data-driven approach to unravel these intricate preferences. My client has established that Conventional methods fall short in providing a comprehensive understanding of customer choices and fail to capture the nuanced trade-offs that consumers make in real-world scenarios. Consequently, there exists a gap in the ability to design products and services that not only meet but exceed customer expectations.

In addressing this challenge, we proposed to approach it through the lens of conjoint analysis which expectedly would fill identified gap by offering a structured methodology to decipher customer preferences, enabling businesses to make informed decisions that resonate with their target audience. 

This project therefore seeks to leverage conjoint analysis to bridge the divide between consumer expectations and product/service offerings, ultimately enhancing decision-making processes for our client in a rapidly evolving market environment.


## Main objective
The main objective of the Conjoint study is to generate insights that enhance decision-making processes for our client, 
            
Specifically, it aims to 
1. Determine how pizza attributes influence consumer decision-making.
2. Quantify Consumer Preferences
3. Optimize Product configuration:
4. Simulate consumer choices and then forecast market share for different pizza scenarios.
        

## Understanding of the data
Instead of asking respondents what they prefer in a product directly, conjoint analysis presents to them potential product profiles that have specific combinations of attributes. These profiles can be evaluated in several ways, including:

Rating (e.g. rating with a scale from 1-10)
Ranking (e.g. rank best as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
Choice (e.g. four options, which do you choose?)

Since this is an experimental design, we came up with theoritical products utilizing the combination of features and asked the customers to rank asking participants to rank products starting with one they would prefer the most as rank 1 to the last.
