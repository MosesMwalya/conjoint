# Conjoint study
Often, deciding between two or more options becomes difficult because we like some features in one option and some features in the other. Worse still, some features makes sense and their benefits is optimal to us as customers when they come alongside others!! So begs the question, what does data driven organizations do to understand ideal mix of features that customer prefers or would choose? We know they canâ€™t afford to make educated guesses about choosing the most appealing features for their customers!! Well, conjoint study is invaluable tool for that exercise.

## Overview
Conjoint study is a statistical technique used in market research that helps determine how people value different attributes (feature, function, benefits) that make up an individual product or service.

The objective of conjoint analysis is to determine what combination of a limited number of attributes is most influential on respondent choice or decision making. A controlled set of potential products or services is shown to survey respondents and by analyzing how they make preferences between these products, the implicit valuation of the individual elements making up the product or service can be determined. These implicit valuations (utilities or part-worths) can be used to create market models that estimate market share, revenue and even profitability of new designs.


## Problem statement
Marketers struggle to find the ideal combination of attributes that would pique a customer's interest in their andeavour to create an appealing product offer. Without that understanding, product development process becomes difficult and would be led by gut feeling and can lead to expensive mistake being commited. Further, even if product is created, marketers would find it difficult when creating advertisement because they wouldnt know features that needs to be given prominence in the communication for them to be able to arrive at a desired goal.
Conjoint study comes in resolve that challenge, by using tried and tested statistical concepts, it is helps decipher the impact of each feature in determining customer preference.

## Main objective
To establish the utility of each feature to enable design and development of a new product according to market requirement.
The objective of the conjoint analysis is to find the combination of attributes or features that the customer most values. This information gives the right level of attributes bundling
    
- **Research question:** To what extend does each factor contribute to the total utility of the product
    
- **Assumptions:** Total Utility = Sum of all partial utilities

## Understanding of the data
Instead of asking respondents what they prefer in a product directly, conjoint analysis presents to them potential product profiles that have specific combinations of attributes. These profiles can be evaluated in several ways, including:

Rating (e.g. rating with a scale from 1-10)
Ranking (e.g. rank best as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
Choice (e.g. four options, which do you choose?)

Since this is an experimental design, we came up with theoritical products utilizing the combination of features and asked the customers to rank asking participants to rank products starting with one they would prefer the most as rank 1 to the last.
